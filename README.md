##### Datasets used:

### [SEA Concepts](https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/sea)

This dataset consists of 50000 instances with three attributes of which only two are relevant.
The two class decision boundary is given by f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub> = b, where f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub> are the two relevant features and b a predefined threshold.
Abrupt drift is simulated with four different concepts, by changing the value of b every 12500 samples.
Also included are 10\% of noise.

### [Rotating Hyperplane](https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/hyperplane)

A hyperplane in d-dimensional space is continuously changed in position and orientation continuous addition.
We used the Random Hyperplane generator in MOA with the same parametrization as in [PAW](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jesse/papers/article2_SAC.pdf) (10 dimensions, 2 classes, delta=0.001).

### [Transient Chessboard](https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/artificial/chess) from (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7837853/)

Virtual drift is generated by revealing successively parts of a chessboard. This is done square by square randomly chosen from the whole chessboard such that each square represents an own concept. 
Every time after four fields have been revealed, samples covering the whole chessboard are presented. 
This reoccurring alternation penalizes algorithms tending to discard former concepts. To reduce the impact of classification by chance we used eight classes instead of two.

### [Weather](https://github.com/vlosing/driftDatasets/tree/master/realWorld/weather) ([original source](http://users.rowan.edu/~polikar/research/nse/))

Elwell et al. introduced this dataset. In the period of 1949-1999 eight different features such as temperature, pressure wind speed etc. were measured at the Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska. 
The target is to predict whether it is going to rain on a certain day or not.
The dataset contains 18159 instances with an imbalance towards no rain (69%).
